## Transit Method and Its Origin

The transit method is a widely used technique in astrophysics for detecting exoplanets. It was first systematically employed in the early 2000s with missions such as NASAâ€™s Kepler Space Telescope. The method works by measuring the dimming of a star's brightness when a planet passes in front of it from our line of sight. This technique allows for the determination of a planet's size, orbital period, and even atmospheric properties in some cases.
